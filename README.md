To do
-----
- Migrate to PostgreSQL
- Get images from youtube api
- Rename image filenames when saving an artwork
- Move homepage css into a separate file
- Make base class for artwork and exhibition model
- Let admin customise copyright line
- Add update multiple mechanism

Done
----
- Add social media links
- Add exhibitions page
- Templates for works and exhibitions detail view could be merged?
- Make it so you can add artworks to exhibitions (as well as exhibitions to artworks) in the admin
- Add option for admin to set the homepage image (instead of hardcoding).
- Stop svg images reloading (and disappearing) when changing page
- Fix production url (e.g. `natashalall.com` works but `www.natashalall.com` doesn't)
