natashalall.com
===============
An artist website in development for Natasha Lall


To do
-----
- Migrate to PostgreSQL
- Fix production url (e.g. `natashalall.com` works but `www.natashalall.com` doesn't)
- Add exhibitions page
- Rename image filenames when saving an artwork
- Add social media links
- Stop svg images reloading (and disappearing) when changing page

Done
----
- Templates for works and exhibitions detail view could be merged?
- Make it so you can add artworks to exhibitions (as well as exhibitions to artworks) in the admin
- Add option for admin to set the homepage image (instead of hardcoding).
